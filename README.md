### Envato Tuts+ Course: [Adobe XD to Code With Avocode 3](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/adobe-xd-to-code-with-avocode-3)
#### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

When you’re handling the process of taking a design and turning it into a fully coded website, trying to work with the same software that was used to create that design in the first place is not always the most efficient thing.

Instead of using something like XD or Sketch or Photoshop, it can be easier to use a handoff application during the coding phase, something like Avocode 3.

Avocode can make it a whole lot easier to do things like exporting images, generating CSS, evaluating measurements, working with variables, and a whole bunch more.

This course is the second in a two part series. In the [first one](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/code-friendly-design-with-adobe-xd) we created a code friendly design in Adobe XD, and in this course we’ll be taking that design and converting it into a fully coded, fully responsive website with the help of Avocode 3. Files for both courses can be found in this repo.
